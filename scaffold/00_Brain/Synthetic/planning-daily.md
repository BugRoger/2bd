# Planning Daily Observations

Raw observations forming into patterns. Automatically clustered; graduates to Semantic when confident.

## Observations

<!-- Append new observations here with format:
- YYYY-MM-DD | type | section | observation text | optional interpretation notes

Example:
- 2026-02-20 | user-modification | Daily Brief | Added "Blockers" section after Priorities | First time; might indicate friction awareness
- 2026-02-20 | session-interaction | Check-In | Answered all questions but kept responses very brief | Time pressure or preference for conciseness?
-->

## Clusters

<!-- Auto-grouped observations with metadata (Claude generates cluster suggestions; user reviews and renames)

Template for each cluster:
### cluster-name
- Confidence: X/5
- Members: N observations (YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD)
- Stable: yes/no (no membership changes past 3 sessions)
- Observations:
  - (copy member observations here)
