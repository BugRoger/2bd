# Review Coaching Guide

Reusable coaching patterns for daily and weekly review rituals.

## Dynamic Question Generation

Generate contextual coaching questions from what actually happened, not pre-phrased templates.

Synthesize questions from:

1. **Day/week content** — meetings held, priorities addressed, captures made, energy reported
2. **Development context** — leadership_identity, growth_edge, key_goals from directives
3. **Day type** — meeting-heavy vs. focused work vs. mixed

## Example Patterns

*If day had multiple 1:1s and growth_edge mentions delegation:*
> "You had three 1:1s today. Did any create space for you to hand something off?"

*If a priority connected to a key goal:*
> "You finished [priority]. How does that move you toward [key goal]?"

*If leadership_intention was "Focused" but calendar was heavy:*
> "You set out to be 'Focused' but had N meetings. How did you protect that intention?"

*If morning energy was "High" but evening mood shifted:*
> "You started the day at high energy but mentioned feeling drained. What shifted?"

*If day shows evidence of a watched pattern:*
> "I noticed back-to-back meetings all afternoon—you mentioned watching for overcommitment. How did that land?"

## Wins Categories

Guide through each category:

- **Personal**: energy protection, boundaries, growth_edge progress
- **Organisational**: team interactions, 1:1 themes, recognition opportunities
- **Strategic**: project progress, key_goals advancement

## Insights Categories

Guide through:

- **What Went Well**: pattern or habit that paid off, source of energy
- **What Could Be Better**: friction points, reactive moments, patterns that emerged
- **Key Insight**: one crystallized learning to carry forward

## Pattern Detection

Look for:

- Themes across meetings, priorities, and captures
- Recurring names, topics, or blockers
- Energy trajectory (morning vs. evening)
- Evidence of watched patterns from directives

Connect insights to longer-term development:
> "How does this fit with where you're trying to grow as a [leadership_identity]?"

## Weekly Synthesis Patterns

For weekly reviews, synthesize across all daily archives.

### Leadership Intention Synthesis

Review each day's leadership intention. Ask:
- Which intention served best across the week?
- Where did they struggle to maintain an intended stance?
- What pattern emerges about when they're at their best?

### Week Theme Identification

After reviewing wins across categories, identify a unifying theme:
- Look for recurring topics, projects, or relationship patterns
- Suggest 2-3 potential themes based on frequency and impact
- Let the user confirm or articulate their own

### Growth Edge Weekly Check-in

Connect to growth_edge from directives:
- Where did it show up this week?
- What progress was made?
- What blocked progress?

### Patterns to Watch Review

Check for watched patterns from directives:
- Did any emerge this week?
- What triggered them?
- What would help prevent them next week?
