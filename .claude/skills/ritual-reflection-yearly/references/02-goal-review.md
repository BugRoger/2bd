# Goal Review

Review the three annual goals established in yearly planning.

## The Three Goals Framework

Year.md defines three goal categories. Review each systematically.

### Personal Goal — Leadership Growth

The leadership transformation or development outcome for the year.

Rate achievement:
- **Achieved** - significant, evidenced growth
- **Partial** - meaningful progress, more to develop
- **Missed** - limited progress, goal remained distant
- **Evolved** - goal transformed during the year

Explore:
- What's your evidence of growth?
- What enabled the progress you made?
- What would have created more growth?

Ask: "How different are you as a leader compared to January?"

### Organisational Goal — Capability Building

The team or organizational capability targeted for the year.

Rate achievement:
- **Achieved** - capability established and functioning
- **Partial** - foundations laid, not yet operational
- **Missed** - blocked or deprioritized
- **Evolved** - different capability emerged as more important

Explore:
- What changed in your organization because of this work?
- What's sustainable vs. what needs continued attention?
- What was harder than expected?

Ask: "What would your team say changed this year?"

### Strategic Goal — Achievement

The concrete achievement that would make the year remarkable.

Rate achievement:
- **Achieved** - delivered and impact visible
- **Partial** - substantial progress, not complete
- **Missed** - fell short of the goal
- **Evolved** - different achievement became more important

Explore:
- What did you actually accomplish vs. what you planned?
- What impact did your work have?
- What would "complete success" have looked like?

Ask: "What achievement would you highlight to your future self?"

## Synthesis Questions

After reviewing all three:

> "Which goal are you most proud of?"

> "Which goal taught you the most, regardless of outcome?"

> "If you could have one do-over, what would it be?"
