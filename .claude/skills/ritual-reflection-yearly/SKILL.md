## Template Contract

Year.md sections updated during review:

| Phase | Updates |
|-------|---------|
| Year Summary | `## Year Summary` |
| Goal Review | `## Goal Review` |
| Leadership Journey | `## Leadership Journey` |
| Life Reflection | `## Life Reflection` |
| (append-only) | `## Changelog` |

Skills reference only H2s. H3 structure within sections is dynamic — the template is a living example that Reflection can evolve based on patterns.
