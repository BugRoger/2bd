# Prior Synthesis

Synthesize learnings from the prior quarter to inform this one. This is retrospective intelligence — patterns, accomplishments, and carryover candidates that shape the quarter ahead.

Skip this phase for Q1 planning when no prior quarter exists.

## Process

1. Extract data from prior quarter archives
2. Synthesize patterns across the three months
3. Present summary to user

## Content

### Monthly Themes

From the three monthly archives:
- **Month 1** — Theme and key focus
- **Month 2** — Theme and evolution
- **Month 3** — Theme and completion arc

Look for: progression, organic themes that emerged, unexpected pivots

### Accomplishments

Synthesize from monthly archives:

**By Category:**
- **Personal** — Leadership growth wins, skills leveled up
- **Organisational** — Team/process improvements shipped
- **Strategic** — Deliverables completed, milestones hit

**Metrics:**
- Outcome completion rate (planned vs achieved)
- Major deliverables shipped
- Notable wins worth celebrating

### Carryover Candidates

From prior Quarter.md and monthly archives:
- Incomplete outcomes from prior quarter
- Items explicitly marked for continuation
- Patterns that need continued attention
- Projects spanning multiple quarters

For each candidate: assess honest effort vs deferral vs abandonment

### Leadership Development Progress

From monthly coaching sections:
- **Growth edge progress** — Movement across three months
- **Coaching insights** — Key realizations captured
- **Avoided conversations** — Trend (improving or recurring)
- **Delegation patterns** — Evolution over the quarter
- **Key relationships** — People invested in, connections deepened

### Active Projects

From project files, present quarterly timeline view:
- All active projects
- Flag overdue (deadlines passed)
- Flag due-soon (deadlines this quarter)
- Next milestone for each
- Note multi-quarter projects

## Update Quarter.md

After presenting prior synthesis:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Quarter.md`
2. Replace `## Synthesis from Prior Quarter` section with:
   - Monthly themes progression
   - Key accomplishments by category
   - Carryover candidates with honest assessment
   - Leadership development progress summary
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Quarter.md`

Proceed to Outcomes.
