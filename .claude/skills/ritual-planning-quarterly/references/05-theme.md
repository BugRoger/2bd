# Theme

Establish a quarterly theme that captures the quarter's essence. This is collaborative — you suggest options, they choose or propose their own.

## Process

1. Generate 2-3 theme suggestions based on context
2. Present options with rationale
3. User chooses or proposes alternative
4. Finalize theme with description

## Content

### Position-Based Themes

Suggest themes based on position in year:

**Q1: Foundation**
- Setting direction and building infrastructure
- Themes: "Foundation", "Alignment", "Launch", "Beginning"
- Energy: Fresh start, planning, establishing patterns
- Risk: Over-planning, analysis paralysis

**Q2: Execution**
- Delivering on plans and adjusting course
- Themes: "Momentum", "Execution", "Building", "Iteration"
- Energy: Head down, shipping, learning from reality
- Risk: Burnout, losing strategic perspective

**Q3: Growth**
- Scaling what works and strengthening foundations
- Themes: "Growth", "Expansion", "Deepening", "Scale"
- Energy: Confidence from progress, reaching further
- Risk: Overextension, neglecting fundamentals

**Q4: Completion**
- Finishing strong and preparing for next year
- Themes: "Harvest", "Completion", "Integration", "Culmination"
- Energy: Closure, celebration, reflection
- Risk: Rush to finish, holiday distraction

### Context Signals

Weight themes based on:
- **Annual theme** — How this quarter contributes to year narrative
- **Prior quarter** — Patterns and trajectory to continue or correct
- **Project deadlines** — Urgency vs space for growth
- **Leadership development** — Opportunities for stretch
- **Energy trends** — Capacity signals from prior quarter
- **User's success vision** — What they said would make this quarter a win

### Conversation Flow

1. **Present options** — Offer 2-3 theme suggestions with:
   - Theme name
   - One-line description
   - Why it fits this quarter
   - What it emphasizes and de-emphasizes

2. **Discuss** — Explore what resonates:
   - Does this capture what you want this quarter to be about?
   - What's missing from these options?
   - Would you phrase it differently?

3. **Finalize** — Confirm theme with:
   - Final theme name
   - Full description (2-3 sentences)
   - What this theme asks of you

## Update Quarter.md

After finalizing theme:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Quarter.md`
2. Replace `## Quarterly Theme` section with:
   - Theme name prominently displayed
   - Theme description
   - What this theme means for the quarter
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Quarter.md`

Proceed to Coaching Themes.
