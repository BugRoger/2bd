# Coaching Themes

Establish self-awareness and coaching focus for the quarter. These cascade to monthly and weekly planning, appearing in Month.md and Week.md coaching sections.

## Process

1. Generate patterns and questions based on context
2. Present for refinement
3. Finalize coaching themes

## Content

### Patterns to Watch

Generate 2-3 patterns based on:
- **Growth edge** from Year.md — What behaviors to notice
- **Prior quarter insights** — What friction points recurred
- **Leadership identity** — What habits support or undermine
- **User's patterns_to_watch** directive
- **Check-in concerns** — What they're worried about

Example patterns:
- "Tendency to solve problems for people instead of asking questions"
- "Energy drain from context-switching between strategic and tactical work"
- "Avoiding difficult conversations until they become urgent"
- "Over-preparing for meetings at the cost of presence"
- "Saying yes to requests before assessing capacity"

Patterns should be:
- Specific enough to recognize in the moment
- Connected to growth edge
- Observable in daily/weekly behaviors
- Neither shaming nor dismissive

### Questions That Serve Me

Generate 3-5 coaching questions based on:
- **Growth edge** — Questions that surface avoidance
- **Leadership identity** — Questions that invoke the leader you want to be
- **Quarter theme** — Questions that keep focus on what matters
- **User's questions_that_serve_me** directive
- **Quarterly outcomes** — Questions that check alignment

Example questions:
- "What are you avoiding?"
- "Who needs to hear something from you?"
- "What would the leader you want to be do right now?"
- "Is this moving the quarter forward or just staying busy?"
- "What conversation would change everything?"
- "Where are you choosing comfort over growth?"

Questions should be:
- Open-ended, not leading
- Provocative but not harsh
- Useful across different situations
- Memorable and repeatable

### Conversation Flow

1. **Present initial set** — Offer patterns and questions with rationale
2. **Refine together** — Ask which resonate, which feel off
3. **Finalize** — Confirm final list that feels right

### Cascade Mechanism

Explain how these cascade:
- Patterns to Watch appear in monthly planning for pattern check
- Questions That Serve Me appear in weekly planning for coaching prompts
- Daily planning references these through Week.md context
- Reviews check progress against these themes

## Update Quarter.md

After finalizing coaching themes:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Quarter.md`
2. Replace `## Coaching Themes` section with:
   - Patterns to Watch (2-3 items)
   - Questions That Serve Me (3-5 items)
   - Note about cascade to monthly/weekly
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Quarter.md`

## Confirm

After writing, summarize:
- The three quarterly outcomes
- The quarterly theme
- Coaching themes (patterns and questions)
- Key projects requiring attention this quarter
- Leadership development focus for the quarter

Suggest strategies for the quarter ahead if helpful.

Proceed to Observe.
