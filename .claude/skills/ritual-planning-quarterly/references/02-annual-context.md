# Annual Context

You've checked in. You understand the user's state, what success looks like, and what concerns them. Now ground the quarter in annual context.

This is the strategic framing — present it, don't negotiate it. The user confirmed their vision in check-in. Your job is to connect it with the year's direction and show where this quarter fits in the bigger picture.

No interaction here. Present the context. Let them absorb it.

## Process

1. Extract context from Year.md
2. Adapt emphasis based on check-in insights
3. Present the context to user

## Content

### Year Theme

From Year.md, present:
- **Theme Name** — The annual theme
- **Theme Description** — What this year is about and why it matters
- **Where Q[N] Fits** — How this quarter contributes to the annual narrative

### Annual Goals

From Year.md, present the three annual goals:
- **Personal Leadership Growth** — The leadership capability being developed
- **Organisational Capability** — The team/org systems being built
- **Strategic Achievement** — The strategic deliverable being pursued

For each, note: current status, what this quarter should advance

### Leadership Development

From Year.md, present:
- **Leadership Identity** — The leader they aspire to be
- **Growth Edge** — Where discomfort lives (the stretch area)
- **Current Focus** — Primary and secondary leadership competencies

Connect to the user's growth intention from check-in.

### Graceful Degradation

If Year.md is missing or incomplete:
- Note what's unavailable
- Suggest running yearly-planning first
- Offer to proceed with reduced context (user confirms)

## Update Quarter.md

After presenting annual context:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Quarter.md`
2. Replace `## Context From Above` section with:
   - Year theme summary
   - Annual goals with quarter relevance
   - Leadership development focus for this quarter
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Quarter.md`

Proceed to Prior Synthesis.
