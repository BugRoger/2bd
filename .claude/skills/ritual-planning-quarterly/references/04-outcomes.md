### Three Quarterly Outcomes

Guide the user to three outcomes, one in each category:

1. **Personal** — What personal leadership skill will you level up this quarter?
   - Connect to growth edge from Year.md
   - Connect to leadership identity aspiration
   - Frame as capability, not activity ("Better at difficult conversations" not "Have more 1:1s")
   - Make measurable: what evidence shows progress?

2. **Organisational** — What organisational capability will you establish?
   - Team structures, processes, or cultural elements
   - Connect to organisational annual goal
   - Frame as state change ("Team has clear decision rights" not "Write RACI document")
   - Make measurable: what looks different by end of quarter?

3. **Strategic** — What strategic outcome demonstrates quarter success?
   - Deliverable or milestone that moves annual goals forward
   - Connect to strategic annual goal
   - Frame as achievement ("Ship v2.0" not "Work on product")
   - Make measurable: what's the definition of done?

### Outcome Framing

For each outcome:
- Outcomes, not activities — What will be different, not what you'll do
- Measurable evidence — How you'll know it's achieved
- Connected to annual — How it advances year goals
- Realistic ambition — Stretching but achievable in 13 weeks

### Conversation Flow

1. **Propose** — Suggest three outcomes based on:
   - Annual goals and where they need advancement
   - Prior quarter carryover candidates
   - Active projects with quarterly deadlines
   - User's success vision from check-in
   - Growth intention mentioned

2. **Refine** — For each outcome:
   - Is this the right scope?
   - Is this truly an outcome, not an activity?
   - How will we know this is done?
   - What makes this a priority over alternatives?

3. **Finalize** — Confirm all three outcomes are:
   - Clear and specific
   - Measurable
   - Ambitious yet achievable
   - Connected to annual direction

## Update Quarter.md

After finalizing outcomes:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Quarter.md`
2. Replace `## Key Outcomes` section with:
   - Three outcomes clearly stated
   - Success criteria for each
   - Connection to annual goals noted
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Quarter.md`

Proceed to Theme.
