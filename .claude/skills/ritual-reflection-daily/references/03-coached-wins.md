# Coached Wins

Guide through wins reflection with personalized coaching. Generate contextual questions from what actually happened, not pre-phrased templates.

## Coaching Source

Synthesize questions from:
1. **Day content** — meetings held, priorities addressed, captures made, energy reported
2. **Development context** — leadership_identity, growth_edge, key_goals from directives
3. **Day type** — meeting-heavy vs. focused work vs. mixed
