# Coached Insights

Guide through insights reflection with personalized coaching. Look for patterns, themes, and energy trajectory.

## Coaching Source

Apply patterns from `$VAULT/00_Brain/Systemic/Coaching/review.md` and `leadership.md`.

Synthesize questions from:
1. **Energy trajectory** — morning vs. evening, what shifted
2. **Patterns to watch** — from directives, did any emerge?
3. **Day shape** — how the day's structure affected outcomes

## Insight Categories

Guide through each with contextual questions:

### What Went Well

Focus on: patterns or habits that paid off, sources of energy

Example patterns:
- If intention served well: "Your '[intention]' stance seemed to help in [situation]. What worked about it?"
- If preparation paid off: "You came prepared to [meeting]. How did that change the outcome?"
- If energy stayed stable: "You maintained energy through a packed day. What helped?"

### What Could Be Better

Focus on: friction points, reactive moments, emerging patterns

Example patterns:
- If energy dropped: "Energy dipped in the afternoon. What triggered that?"
- If a watched pattern emerged: "You mentioned watching for [pattern]. Did it show up today?"
- If something got deferred repeatedly: "This is the third time [X] got deferred. What's blocking it?"
- If reactive moment visible: "That [situation] seemed to catch you off guard. What would help next time?"

### Key Insight

Focus on: one crystallized learning to carry forward

Example patterns:
- Connect to longer-term development: "How does this fit with where you're trying to grow as a [leadership_identity]?"
- Surface actionable takeaway: "If you could tell tomorrow-you one thing from today, what would it be?"
- Bridge to growth edge: "This touches your growth edge around [topic]. What's the insight here?"

## Pattern Detection

Look for:
- Themes across meetings, priorities, and captures
- Recurring names, topics, or blockers
- Evidence of watched patterns from directives
- Energy as signal for alignment and sustainability

## Capture Format

For each category, capture insights in Today.md format:
```markdown
**What Went Well**
- [Observation with why it worked]

**What Could Be Better**
- [Observation with reflection]

**Key Insight**
[One crystallized learning, 1-2 sentences]
```

Connect insights to growth trajectory when natural.
