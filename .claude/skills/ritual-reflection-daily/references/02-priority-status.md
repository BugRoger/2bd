# Priority Status

Review each priority from Today.md to capture completion status and context for carry-forward.

## Process

For each priority in Today.md `## Daily Brief` > `### Priorities`:

1. **State** the priority text and any visible completion status
2. **Ask**: "How did this go? Completed / Partial / Deferred?"
3. **Capture context** based on response:

### Completed
- Note what enabled completion
- Identify any follow-up items generated

### Partial
- What got done vs. what remains?
- What blocked full completion?
- Should this carry to tomorrow or drop?

### Deferred
- Why was it deferred? (blocked, deprioritized, overtaken by events)
- When should it be revisited?
- Any context to capture for future self?

## Carry-Forward

For partial or deferred priorities:
- Note context that tomorrow's planning should know
- Identify any blockers to address
- Flag if this is becoming a recurring deferral (potential pattern)

## Energy Connection

Connect completion status to energy trajectory:
- Did energy enable or block completion?
- Did completion affect energy positively or negatively?

This connection surfaces in Coached Insights.
