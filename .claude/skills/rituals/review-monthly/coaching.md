# Monthly Review Coaching Guide

Coaching patterns specific to monthly review rituals. Extends the base patterns from daily-review/coaching.md with monthly-scale reflection.

## Monthly-Specific Coaching Questions

Generate contextual coaching questions from what actually happened across the month, not pre-phrased templates.

Synthesize questions from:

1. **Month content** — outcomes defined, weeks completed, energy trends
2. **Development context** — leadership_identity, growth_edge, key_goals from directives
3. **Month character** — project-heavy vs. relationship-focused vs. strategic

## Growth Edge Progress

Connect to growth_edge from directives with monthly perspective:

- Where did the growth edge show up this month?
- What sustained progress was made (vs. one-off attempts)?
- What blocked deeper progress?
- How has understanding of the growth edge evolved?

Example patterns:

*If growth_edge mentions delegation and month had team expansion:*
> "You added two people to the team this month. How did that change your relationship with delegation?"

*If growth_edge mentions presence and month had high meeting load:*
> "Meeting hours were up 20% this month. How did that affect your ability to be fully present?"

## Avoided Conversations

Monthly scale reveals conversation patterns that daily/weekly views miss:

- What conversation has been put off for weeks?
- Who needs feedback that hasn't been given?
- What decision is waiting for a discussion that keeps getting delayed?
- What would be different if that conversation happened tomorrow?

*If a person appeared frequently in weekly archives without resolution:*
> "[Name] showed up in three weekly reviews with unresolved items. What conversation would change that?"

## Delegation Patterns

Monthly view shows delegation trends:

- What got delegated successfully this month?
- What should have been delegated but wasn't?
- Who is ready for more responsibility?
- What are you holding onto that no longer serves you?

*If outcome completion was partial and calendar was heavy:*
> "Two outcomes are incomplete and your calendar averaged N meetings/week. What would you need to let go of to create space?"

## Self-Care Reflection

Monthly energy and sustainability check:

- How did energy trend across the month (start vs. middle vs. end)?
- What boundaries served well and should be maintained?
- What boundaries eroded and need reinforcing?
- What would "sustainable" look like next month?

*If weekly energy patterns showed decline:*
> "Energy started high in week 1 but dropped steadily. What would have maintained it?"

## Pattern Recognition

Look for systemic patterns across weeks:

- What themes appeared in multiple weekly reviews?
- What friction points recurred without resolution?
- What successes could be systematized?
- What one-off issues are actually systemic?

Connect to longer-term development:
> "This pattern has shown up three months in a row. What would it take to actually address it?"

## Looking Forward

Monthly review shapes the next month:

- What outcome matters most for next month?
- What would make this a defining month in your year?
- What needs to change from this month's approach?
- What support or resources would help?

*If this is a quarter boundary:*
> "Next month starts a new quarter. What would make it a strong start?"

## Outcome Categories

Guide through each outcome type:

- **Completed** — What made success possible? Who helped? What can be celebrated?
- **Partial** — What's the real blocker? Is completion still the right goal? What would it take to finish?
- **Deferred** — Why was it deferred? Is it still relevant? What does the deferral reveal?

## Theme Identification

After reviewing outcomes and wins, identify the month's defining theme:

- Look for what connected the successes
- Notice what pattern explains the challenges
- Suggest 2-3 potential themes based on impact
- Let the user confirm or articulate their own

## Patterns to Watch Review

Check for watched patterns from directives at monthly scale:

- Did any watched patterns become habitual this month?
- What triggered them repeatedly?
- What would structurally prevent them next month?
- Is this pattern getting better, worse, or stable over time?
