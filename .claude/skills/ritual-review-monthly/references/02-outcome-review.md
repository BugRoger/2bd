# Outcome Review

Review the three outcome categories from Month.md. This is a structured reflection — guide the user through each, then synthesize.

## Process

1. Review each outcome from Month.md Key Outcomes
2. Guide user through categorization
3. Synthesize the pattern across outcomes

## The Three Outcomes

From Month.md, review each in order:

### Personal Outcome

*"What personal development will you invest in?"*

Review what was set vs what happened:
- Progress evidence from weekly archives
- Growth moments noted in weekly Wins
- Connection to annual growth edge

Categorize as:
- **Completed** — fully achieved, celebrate the success
- **Partial** — progress made but not complete, identify what remains
- **Deferred** — moved to next month or dropped, understand why

### Organisational Outcome

*"What organisational/team capability will you build?"*

Review what was set vs what happened:
- Team achievements from weekly archives
- Capability improvements noted
- Connection to quarterly/annual goals

Categorize using the same framework.

### Strategic Outcome

*"What strategic milestone marks this month complete?"*

Review what was set vs what happened:
- Project progress from weekly archives
- Milestone completions
- Strategic decisions made

Categorize using the same framework.

## Synthesis Questions

After reviewing all three, ask:

1. **"Which outcome are you most proud of?"**
   - Capture what made it successful
   - Note replicable patterns

2. **"Which outcome taught you the most?"**
   - Capture the learning regardless of completion status
   - Note what would be done differently

## Update Month.md

After synthesis:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Month.md`
2. Replace or create `## Outcome Review` section
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Month.md`

### Section Format
