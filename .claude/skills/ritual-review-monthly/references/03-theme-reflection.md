# Theme Reflection

Reflect on the month's theme and what actually emerged. The stated theme and lived experience often diverge — that divergence is meaningful.

## Process

1. Review the planned theme from Month.md
2. Guide reflection on actual lived experience
3. Surface what the month was really about
4. Seed next month's theme

## Review Planned Theme

From Month.md Monthly Theme:
- What theme was set during monthly planning?
- Why was this theme chosen at the time?
- What did the user hope it would provide?

## Reflection Questions

Guide the user through:

### Did the Theme Serve?

**"Looking back, did the theme '[theme]' serve you this month?"**

Explore:
- Moments when the theme guided decisions
- Times when the theme felt irrelevant or forgotten
- Whether the theme created focus or felt constraining

### What Emerged Instead?

**"What was this month actually about?"**

Sometimes a month has a different character than planned:
- A "Execution" month becomes a "Crisis Management" month
- A "Growth" month becomes a "Foundation Building" month
- A "Strategic" month becomes a "Relationship" month

Capture what theme the month actually embodied.

### Theme for Next Month

**"Based on what emerged, what theme would serve next month?"**

Consider:
- Continuation if current theme still needs attention
- Pivot if something new emerged that needs focus
- Contrast if the month calls for a different energy
- Integration if multiple threads need weaving

## Update Month.md

After reflection:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Month.md`
2. Replace or create `## Theme Reflection` section
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Month.md`

### Section Format

```markdown
