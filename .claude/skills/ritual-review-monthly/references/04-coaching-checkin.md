# Coaching Check-in

Monthly coaching reflection connects weekly patterns to longer-term growth. This is about patterns, not incidents.

## Process

1. Apply coaching guidance from loaded context
2. Guide reflection on growth edge and patterns
3. Capture coaching insights

## Coaching Framework

Apply monthly coaching guidance from `00_Brain/Systemic/Coaching/review-monthly.md` if loaded.

Connect to directives:
- `user.growth_edge` — the development area being worked on
- `user.patterns_to_watch` — habitual patterns that limit effectiveness
- `user.leadership_identity` — the leader they're becoming

## Reflection Questions

### Growth Edge Progress

**"Where did your growth edge show up this month?"**

From weekly coaching sections:
- Moments of growth edge practice
- Challenges that tested the edge
- Progress made vs same time last month

**"What progress did you make?"**

Capture concrete examples, not aspirations.

### Patterns That Emerged

**"Which watched patterns showed up this month?"**

From weekly patterns:
- Patterns that recurred across weeks
- Triggers that activated patterns
- New patterns that emerged

**"What triggered them?"**

Understanding triggers enables intervention.

### Questions That Helped

**"What coaching questions were most valuable this month?"**

From weekly check-ins:
- Questions that prompted insight
- Questions that felt flat or missed
- New questions that emerged

This feeds back into coaching file evolution.

### Self-Care Reflection

**"How is your energy as the month closes?"**

Monthly energy is more meaningful than daily:
- Sustainable pace or depleted?
- Boundaries that served well
- What needs protection next month

## Update Month.md

After reflection:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Month.md`
2. Replace or update `## Coaching Check-in` section
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Month.md`
