# Goal Review

Review the three key outcomes from Quarter.md.

## Three Outcomes Framework

Quarter.md defines three outcome types. Review each systematically.

### Personal Outcome

The leadership skill or personal growth targeted this quarter.

Rate progress:
- **Completed** - fully achieved, evidence of growth
- **Partial** - progress made, more work needed
- **Deferred** - moved to next quarter or dropped

Ask: "What's your evidence of growth here?"

### Organisational Outcome

The team or organizational capability to establish.

Rate progress:
- **Completed** - capability established and functioning
- **Partial** - foundations laid, not yet operational
- **Deferred** - blocked or reprioritized

Ask: "What changed in your organization because of this?"

### Strategic Outcome

The achievement that demonstrates quarter success.

Rate progress:
- **Completed** - delivered and impact visible
- **Partial** - in progress, not yet complete
- **Deferred** - timeline shifted

Ask: "What would have made this a complete success?"

## Synthesis Questions

After reviewing all three:

> "Which outcome are you most proud of?"

> "Which outcome taught you the most?"

> "What would you do differently if starting this quarter again?"

## Update Wins Section

Populate `## Wins This Quarter` in Quarter.md with:
- Personal wins under `### Personal`
- Organisational wins under `### Organisational`
- Strategic wins under `### Strategic`

Include specific accomplishments, not just status.
