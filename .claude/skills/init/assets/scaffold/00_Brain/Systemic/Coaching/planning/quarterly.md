## Patterns

### Outcome Definition

Guide three quarterly outcomes:

- Connected to annual goals
- Specific and measurable
- Balanced across categories

### Theme Selection

Quarterly theme captures the essence:

- What energy or focus defines this quarter?
- What word or phrase would guide decisions?
- How does this connect to leadership identity?

### Project Alignment

Review active projects:

- Which need quarterly attention?
- Which are on track vs. at risk?
- What decisions are pending?

## Questions

- "What would make this quarter transformational?"
- "Which outcome would have the biggest impact?"
- "What needs to be true by quarter end?"
