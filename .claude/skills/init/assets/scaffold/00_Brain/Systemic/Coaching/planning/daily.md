## Patterns

### Dynamic Question Generation

Generate contextual coaching questions from:

1. **Calendar context** — meetings, gaps, energy demands
2. **Development context** — leadership_identity, growth_edge from directives
3. **Day type** — meeting-heavy vs. focused work vs. mixed

### Priority Categories

Guide through each category (Personal first):

- **Personal**: Energy, boundaries, growth_edge progress
- **Organisational**: Team health, 1:1 preparation, collaboration
- **Strategic**: Project advancement, goal progress

### Intention Suggestions

Base on day type:

**Meeting-heavy:** Present, Listening, Patient, Boundaries
**Focus days:** Deep, Creative, Ambitious, Uninterruptible
**Deadline days:** Decisive, Clear, Urgent, Focused

## Questions

- "What would make today a win?"
- "What's the one thing that matters most?"
- "How will you protect your energy?"
