# Yearly Review Coaching Guide

Coaching patterns specific to yearly review rituals. Extends the base patterns from quarterly-review/coaching.md with year-scale reflection that captures leadership evolution and crystallized learning.

## Yearly-Specific Coaching Questions

Generate contextual coaching questions from what actually happened across the year, not pre-phrased templates.

Synthesize questions from:

1. **Year content** — annual goals defined, quarters completed, strategic arc
2. **Development context** — leadership_identity, growth_edge, key_goals from directives
3. **Year character** — transformation year vs. consolidation year vs. transition year

## Defining Moment

Every year has moments that define it:

- What was the defining moment of this year?
- When did you feel most alive in your work?
- What situation tested you in ways you didn't expect?
- What moment would you want to relive?
- What moment changed how you see yourself?

Example patterns:

*If growth_edge involved difficult conversations and there were significant team changes:*
> "This year had major team transitions. Which conversation changed everything, and what did it reveal about who you've become?"

*If annual goals were ambitious and largely achieved:*
> "You achieved things this year you might not have believed possible in January. What moment made you realize you could do this?"

## Leadership Growth

The yearly view reveals fundamental leadership evolution:

- How did you grow as a leader this year?
- What leadership challenge at the start of the year now feels easy?
- What would you tell yourself at the start of this year?
- Who helped you grow, and have you thanked them?
- What's the biggest difference between January-you and December-you?

Example patterns:

*If growth_edge showed progression across quarters:*
> "Your relationship with [growth_edge] transformed this year. Q1 was recognition, Q4 was coaching others. What made that shift possible?"

*If leadership_identity deepened:*
> "You've been living into '[leadership_identity]' all year. Where does that feel most true now?"

## What Would You Tell Yourself

The yearly perspective enables wisdom:

- What would you tell yourself at the start of this year?
- What advice would January-you have needed to hear?
- What did you worry about that turned out fine?
- What did you not anticipate that mattered most?

*If the year had unexpected challenges:*
> "If you could send a message back to January, knowing what [challenge] was coming, what would you say?"

*If the year exceeded expectations:*
> "January-you might not have believed this year was possible. What would you tell yourself to trust?"

## Gratitude

Yearly review is the time for deep gratitude:

- What are you most grateful for from this year?
- Who made this year possible?
- What blessing came disguised as a challenge?
- What do you appreciate now that you took for granted in January?

*If specific people appeared consistently:*
> "[[PersonName]] showed up in every quarter. What are you grateful for about that relationship?"

*If the year involved growth:*
> "Growth is often uncomfortable. What are you grateful for about the discomfort you experienced?"

## Next Year Focus

Frame what next year could be about:

- What do you want next year to be about?
- If next year had a title, what would it be?
- What's the one thing that would make next year successful?
- What do you want to carry forward vs. leave behind?
- What are you ready for that you weren't ready for last January?

Example patterns:

*If this was a foundation year:*
> "You built foundations this year. What do you want to build on them next year?"

*If this was a consolidation year:*
> "This year was about making things solid. Is next year the time to expand, or go deeper?"

*If this was a transformation year:*
> "You transformed significantly this year. What's the natural next step of that evolution?"

## Annual Goal Categories

Guide through each goal type with yearly lens:

- **Achieved** — What made success possible? What can be replicated? How did achieving this change you?
- **Partial** — What's the real story? Was the goal right? What would you do differently?
- **Missed** — Why was it missed? Was it the right goal? What did you learn?
- **Evolved** — How did it change? Was the evolution right? What does that tell you about goal-setting?

*If there were recurring patterns across quarters:*
> "[Pattern] appeared in every quarter. What does that tell you about how you operate?"

## Energy and Sustainability

Yearly patterns in energy management:

- What sustained you across the full year?
- When were you at your best? What created those conditions?
- What depleted you? How will you protect against that?
- Did you maintain sustainable pace or accumulate debt?

*If energy showed patterns:*
> "Your energy [rose/fell/varied] predictably through the year. What does that pattern tell you?"

*If burnout risk appeared:*
> "[Quarter] showed warning signs. What would you do differently to protect yourself?"

## Crystallized Insights

## Multi-Year Context

If previous yearly archives exist, connect patterns:

- How does this year compare to previous years?
- What progress did you make on multi-year goals?
- What patterns persist across years?
- Are you on the trajectory you want?

*If multi-year goals exist:*
> "Your multi-year vision was [vision]. How did this year move you toward it?"

*If patterns repeat:*
> "[Pattern] appeared last year too. Is this something to accept, leverage, or change?"
