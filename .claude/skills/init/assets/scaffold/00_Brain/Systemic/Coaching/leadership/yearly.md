## Patterns

### Leadership Identity Evolution

Yearly is the time to revisit and refine:

- Who are you becoming as a leader?
- What identity served you this year?
- What identity calls to you for next year?

### Growth Edge Selection

Choose the stretch area for the year:

- What would unlock significant growth?
- Where does discomfort live?
- What have you been avoiding?

### Vision Alignment

Connect daily choices to long-term vision:

- What does success look like in 5 years?
- How does this year move you toward that?
- What needs to be true by year end?

## Questions

- "What would make you proud at year end?"
- "What pattern has held you back?"
- "What would the leader you want to be commit to this year?"
