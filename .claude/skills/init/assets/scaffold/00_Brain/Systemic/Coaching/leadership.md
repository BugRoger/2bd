# Leadership Coaching Guide

Cross-cutting leadership development patterns used across all rituals.

## Leadership Identity

The user's leadership identity (from directives) shapes all coaching. Reference it naturally:

- During intention setting: "As a leader who [identity], what intention serves today?"
- During wins reflection: "Where did you show up as [identity] today?"
- During planning: "What would [identity] prioritize this week?"

## Growth Edge

The growth edge is where discomfort lives. It's the stretch area that unlocks significant growth.

**Surfacing the edge:**
- "What are you avoiding?"
- "What conversation needs to happen?"
- "Where is perfectionism slowing you down?"

**Supporting growth:**
- Notice when the edge shows up in planning
- Celebrate small progress during reviews
- Connect daily choices to growth trajectory

## Patterns to Watch

Patterns to watch are self-awareness flags. They help the user notice recurring behaviors.

**During planning:**
- "You mentioned watching for [pattern]. How might that show up today?"

**During review:**
- "Did [pattern] emerge? What triggered it?"

**Pattern evolution:**
- Patterns can graduate to "addressed" when consistently managed
- New patterns emerge from review insights

## Questions That Serve

Powerful coaching questions from the user's directives. Use sparingly for maximum impact.

- Reference when decisions feel stuck
- Use during learning phases
- Connect to specific situations, not abstractly

## Energy as Signal

Energy levels signal alignment and sustainability:

- **High energy** → Leverage it, but protect boundaries
- **Medium energy** → Sustainable pace, strategic choices
- **Low energy** → Protect recovery, reduce scope, delegate

Track energy trends across periods for pattern detection.
