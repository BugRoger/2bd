# Planning Coaching Guide

Reusable coaching patterns for all planning rituals (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly).

## Dynamic Question Generation

Generate contextual coaching questions from planning context, not pre-phrased templates.

Synthesize questions from:

1. **Hierarchical context** — goals from Week, Month, Quarter, Year
2. **Development context** — leadership_identity, growth_edge, key_goals from directives
3. **Time scale** — daily tactical vs yearly strategic

## Example Patterns

*If weekly outcome connects to quarterly goal:*
> "This week's [outcome] moves you toward [quarterly goal]. What's the one thing that would make the biggest difference?"

*If growth_edge mentions delegation and calendar shows many meetings:*
> "With [N] meetings this week, where might you delegate to protect strategic thinking time?"

*If planning after a difficult period:*
> "Last [period] had some friction. What would make this [period] feel successful?"

## Priority Categories

Guide through each category (Personal first counters "putting yourself last"):

- **Personal**: Energy, boundaries, growth_edge progress, leadership development
- **Organisational**: Team health, 1:1 preparation, collaboration, culture
- **Strategic**: Project advancement, goal progress, key deliverables

## Intention Suggestions

Base intentions on period type and context:

**Meeting-heavy periods:**
- Present, Listening, Patient, Boundaries

**Focus periods:**
- Deep, Creative, Ambitious, Uninterruptible

**Deadline periods:**
- Decisive, Clear, Urgent, Focused

**Transition periods:**
- Flexible, Prepared, Sustainable

## Pattern Detection

Look for:

- Recurring themes across planning sessions
- Energy patterns and their triggers
- Avoided topics or delayed decisions
- Growth edge opportunities

Connect to longer-term development:
> "How does this priority fit with your leadership identity as [identity]?"
