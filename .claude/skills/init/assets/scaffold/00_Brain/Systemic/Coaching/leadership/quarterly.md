# Leadership Coaching — Quarterly

## Overview

Quarterly leadership patterns for theme setting, coaching focus, and development trajectory.

## Systems

<!-- Add coaching systems here. Examples:
     - OKR alignment check
     - 90-day leadership sprint
     - Coaching theme setting
-->

## Patterns

### Coaching Themes

Establish patterns to watch and questions that serve for the quarter:

**Patterns to Watch** — Generate 2-3 based on:
- Growth edge from Year.md
- Prior quarter insights
- Leadership identity alignment

**Questions That Serve** — Generate 3-5 based on:
- Growth edge (questions that surface avoidance)
- Leadership identity (questions that invoke the leader you want to be)
- Quarter theme (questions that keep focus)

### Cascade Mechanism

Coaching themes cascade:
- Patterns to Watch appear in weekly planning
- Questions That Serve Me appear in weekly coaching prompts
- Daily planning references through Week.md context

## Questions

- "What would make this quarter transformational?"
- "Where is your growth edge calling you?"
- "What conversation would change everything this quarter?"
