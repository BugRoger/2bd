# Quarterly Review Coaching Guide

Coaching patterns specific to quarterly review rituals. Extends the base patterns from monthly-review/coaching.md with quarter-scale reflection.

## Quarterly-Specific Coaching Questions

Generate contextual coaching questions from what actually happened across the quarter, not pre-phrased templates.

Synthesize questions from:

1. **Quarter content** — outcomes defined, months completed, strategic progress
2. **Development context** — leadership_identity, growth_edge, key_goals from directives
3. **Quarter character** — execution-heavy vs. relationship-focused vs. transition period

## Leadership Moment

The quarterly scale reveals defining leadership moments:

- What was your biggest leadership moment this quarter?
- Where did you step into your leadership identity most fully?
- What situation called for leadership you didn't know you had?
- Who would describe your leadership differently after this quarter?

Example patterns:

*If growth_edge mentions difficult conversations and quarter had team changes:*
> "You navigated significant team transitions this quarter. Which conversation was hardest, and what made you show up for it?"

*If leadership_identity mentions coaching and quarter had high 1:1 engagement:*
> "You invested heavily in 1:1s this quarter. What coaching moment are you most proud of?"

## Growth Edge Progress

Connect to growth_edge from directives with quarterly perspective:

- Where did you grow into your leadership identity this quarter?
- What growth became visible that wasn't at the start?
- What would you tell yourself three months ago about this growth edge?
- How has your relationship with this edge evolved?

Look for trajectory across months:

*If monthly coaching data shows progression:*
> "In January you were recognizing avoidance patterns. By March you were proactively addressing tensions. What shifted?"

*If monthly data shows stagnation:*
> "This growth edge appeared in all three months. What's keeping it from shifting?"

## Strategic Bets

Quarterly scale is where strategy becomes visible:

- What strategic bet would you make differently?
- What did you invest in that didn't pay off?
- What did you underinvest in that deserved more?
- What opportunity did you see but not act on?

Connect outcomes to strategy:

*If key outcomes were partially achieved:*
> "Two of three outcomes are incomplete. Were these the right bets, or did circumstances change?"

*If unexpected wins appeared:*
> "Some of your biggest wins weren't in the original outcomes. What does that tell you about your planning?"

## What to Stop

Quarterly review is the time to identify what's not serving:

- What do you need to stop doing next quarter?
- What activity consumed time without returning value?
- What commitment felt obligatory but not meaningful?
- What would you protect if you had to drop 20% of your work?

Look for patterns across months:

*If same friction appeared in multiple months:*
> "[Activity/commitment] showed up as friction in all three months. What would it take to stop?"

*If energy data shows consistent drains:*
> "Calendar data shows [pattern]. What's one thing you could stop to reclaim that energy?"

## Outcome Categories

Guide through each outcome type with quarterly lens:

- **Completed** — What made success possible? What can be replicated? How does it connect to annual goals?
- **Partial** — What's the real blocker? Is completion still the right goal? What would finishing unlock?
- **Deferred** — Why was it deferred? Is it still relevant? What does the deferral reveal about priorities?

## Coaching Themes Review

Reflect on the coaching apparatus that was set up for the quarter:

### Patterns to Watch
- Which patterns showed up as predicted?
- Which patterns improved over the quarter?
- Which patterns persisted despite attention?
- What new patterns emerged that should be watched?

### Questions That Served
- Which coaching questions were most valuable?
- Which questions led to actual behavior change?
- What question would you add for next quarter?
- What question felt irrelevant and should be dropped?

## People and Relationships

Quarterly scale reveals relationship investment patterns:

- Who got significant attention this quarter? Was that the right investment?
- Who was neglected that needs attention next quarter?
- What relationship improved most? What enabled that?
- What relationship deteriorated? What would repair it?

*If people data shows concentration:*
> "You spent the most time with [names]. Is that the right allocation for your role?"

*If key people are absent from data:*
> "[Critical relationship] barely appears this quarter. Is that a gap or intentional?"

## Annual Alignment

Connect quarter progress to year goals:

- Which annual goals made meaningful progress this quarter?
- At this pace, will you achieve your annual goals?
- What needs to shift in Q[N+1] to get on track?
- Does your annual theme still feel true?

*If annual goals are off track:*
> "Based on Q1-Q[N], you're [X]% toward annual goals with [Y] quarters remaining. What would change the trajectory?"

*If annual theme has drifted:*
> "Your annual theme was '[theme]'. How did this quarter align or diverge?"

## Energy and Sustainability

Quarterly view shows sustainable vs. unsustainable patterns:

- What practice kept you energized across the quarter?
- What depleted you that you kept doing anyway?
- When were you at your best? What conditions created that?
- What sustainable practices emerged? What should continue?

*If energy trends showed decline:*
> "Energy trended down across the quarter. What would reset it for Q[N+1]?"

*If energy was inconsistent:*
> "January was high energy, February dropped, March recovered. What explains the variance?"

## Forward Focus

Quarterly review shapes the next quarter:

- What outcome matters most for next quarter?
- What leadership challenge do you need to prepare for?
- What support or resources would help?
- What one thing would make it your best quarter yet?

*If this is year-end:*
> "This was your final quarter of [year]. What would you tell yourself at the start of [next year]?"

*If mid-year:*
> "You're halfway through the year. What adjustment would make the second half better than the first?"
