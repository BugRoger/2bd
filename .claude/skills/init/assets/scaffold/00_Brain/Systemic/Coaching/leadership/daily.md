### Leadership Identity

Reference leadership identity naturally during daily rituals:

- During wins reflection: "Where did you show up as [identity] today?"

### Growth Edge

The growth edge is where discomfort lives. Surface it daily:

- "What are you avoiding today?"
- "What conversation needs to happen?"
- "Where might perfectionism slow you down?"

### Energy as Signal

Energy levels signal alignment:

- **High energy** — Leverage it, protect boundaries
- **Medium energy** — Sustainable pace, strategic choices
- **Low energy** — Protect recovery, reduce scope, delegate

## Questions

- "What would the leader you want to be do right now?"
- "Where are you choosing comfort over growth today?"
- "What pattern might show up today?"
