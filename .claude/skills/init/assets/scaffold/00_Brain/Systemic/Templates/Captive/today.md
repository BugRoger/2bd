## Daily Brief

**This Week's Focus:** Ship the API redesign — demonstrate technical leadership through execution

**Growth Edge:** Notice when perfectionism slows decisions. With 8 meetings and limited focus time, choose progress over polish.

You have a packed morning with back-to-back meetings until lunch. Two 1:1s this afternoon, then a strategic planning session. Your 2 hours of focus time are fragmented — protect the 14:00-15:00 block fiercely.

### Priorities
1. **API spec approval** — Get stakeholder sign-off in the 10:00 review. Clears the team's path forward.
2. **Alex career conversation** — She needs clarity on growth direction. Come with concrete options, not open questions.
3. **30-min walk at lunch** — Non-negotiable. Afternoon meetings require presence.

### Intention
**Decisive** — Move things forward. Don't let perfect block good enough.

## Journal

### Wins
**Personal**
- Protected lunch walk despite back-to-back pressure
- Made decisive call in API review — didn't let perfect block good enough

**Team**
- Clear outcome from Alex 1:1 — she has concrete next steps now
- Standup was efficient — 15 minutes, clear decisions

**Strategic**
- API spec approved — major blocker cleared for Q1 delivery
- Strategy session aligned team on Q2 direction

### Insights
**What Went Well**
- "Decisive" intention served well — noticed myself moving faster in meetings
- Preparation for Alex 1:1 paid off — had options ready

**What Could Be Better**
- Spaced out during strategy session second half — energy flagged after skipping morning break
- Took on action item I should have delegated (sprint board update)

**Key Insight**
When energy drops, delegation instincts weaken. Build "who else could do this?" into meeting prep, not just meeting itself.
