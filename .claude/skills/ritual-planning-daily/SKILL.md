# Daily Planning

1. [Setup](references/00-setup.md)
2. [Check-In](references/01-checkin.md)
3. [Daily Brief](references/02-daily-brief.md)
4. [Meetings](references/03-meetings.md)
5. [Journal](references/04-journal.md)
6. [Observe](references/05-observe.md)

## Template Contract

Today.md has four H2 sections that phases update:

| Phase | Updates |
|-------|---------|
| Daily Brief | `## Daily Brief` |
| Meetings | `## Meetings` |
| Journal | `## Journal` |
| (append-only) | `## Changelog` |

Skills reference only H2s. H3 structure within sections is dynamic — the template is a living example that Observe can evolve based on patterns.
