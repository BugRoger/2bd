# Session Flow

Detailed guidance for each phase of the daily planning session.

## 1. Context From Above

Present a focused Top 3 Context Summary for Today.md's "Context From Above" section.

See [context-summary.md](context-summary.md) for detailed structure and examples.

Key elements:
- **This Week's Focus** — Key outcome + theme from Week.md
- **Critical Projects** — Overdue or due-soon only
- **Growth Edge** — Single most relevant pattern to watch

## 2. Focus

Ask about the day's constraints and establish priorities.

### Gather Metadata

Ask the user about:
- **Energy level** — High/Medium/Low (for frontmatter)
- **Work location** — Home/Office/Travel/Other (for frontmatter)
- **Deadlines or constraints** — Any hard deadlines today

Calculate from calendar:
- **focus_hours** — Count gaps between 8am-6pm minus meetings
- **meetings** — Count scheduled meetings

### Establish Priorities

See [priorities-framework.md](priorities-framework.md) for the three-priority framework.

Review hierarchical context and active projects. Identify three outcomes:

1. **Must happen** — Critical outcome defining success. Connect to weekly key outcomes or overdue projects.
2. **Team/strategic** — Moves team or strategy forward. Align with monthly theme or weekly focus.
3. **Personal/operational** — Something for yourself or routine operations. Reference patterns to watch.

Frame as outcomes, not tasks. What will be different by end of day?

### Set Leadership Intention

Suggest 2-3 intentions based on day shape. User chooses one.

| Day Shape | Suggested Intentions |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Heavy meetings | Present, Listening, Patient |
| Many 1:1s | Supportive, Coaching, Curious |
| Deadline pressure | Decisive, Confident, Clear |
| Low energy | Sustainable, Boundaries, Selective |
| Light calendar | Creative, Ambitious, Momentum |

## 3. Meetings

### Calendar Review

Review the calendar. List meetings excluding routine items that don't need notes:
- Lunch, Focus Work/Time, Prep/Preparation
- Blockers, Break, Coffee

### 1:1 Context Enrichment

For each 1:1 meeting, review their People file thoroughly. Present enriched context:

- **Last interaction date** — When did you last meet or have significant interaction?
- **Active topics** — Ongoing conversations or themes from recent 1:1s
- **Related projects** — Projects they're involved in or leading
- **Recent updates** — Wins, blockers, or context worth mentioning
- **Team context** — If direct report, current team/project status

Ask what the user wants to focus on with that person.

Use meeting templates from the vault template (`00_Brain/Systemic/Templates/Captive/today.md`).
Templates are embedded in HTML comments and evolve based on user preferences.

## 4. Wins Coaching Prompts

Generate personalized prompts for the Wins section connecting to:

- Today's priorities and leadership intention
- Weekly key outcomes and focus theme
- Active project milestones approaching
- Key interactions and 1:1 opportunities

Make prompts feel personalized to the specific day, not generic templates. Reference actual project names, people, and context.

## 5. Insights Coaching Prompts

Generate personalized prompts for the Insights section connecting to:

- Patterns to watch (from Week.md coaching check-in)
- Monthly theme alignment
- Leadership development themes from directives
- Day-type context (meeting-heavy, deadline, creative)

Connect prompts to the user's growth edge and coaching questions from directives.
