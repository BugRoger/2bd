# Context Summary Guide

Build a focused "Context From Above" section for Today.md.

## Structure

Present three elements in this exact order:

### 1. This Week's Focus

Pull from Week.md:
- **Key outcome** — Pick the most relevant from Week.md Key Outcomes
- **Weekly theme** — From Week.md Focus Theme

Combine into single line: "[Key Outcome] + Theme: [Focus Theme]"

### 2. Critical Projects

From active project files:
- List ONLY overdue or due-soon projects (no icons)
- Include next milestone for each
- If none urgent, show top 1-2 active projects by due date

Project urgency detection:
- **Overdue** — Due date has passed
- **Due-soon** — Due date within 7 days

### 3. Growth Edge

From Quarter.md or Week.md coaching:
- Single most relevant pattern to watch
- Connect to day's shape (meeting-heavy, deadline pressure, etc.)

## Output Format

```markdown
## Context From Above
> **This Week's Focus:** Ship Q1 planning deck (Key Outcome) + Theme: Strategic clarity
> **Growth Edge:** Notice when perfectionism delays decisions
```

## Day-Type Adaptation

| Day Type | Emphasis |
|----------|----------|
| Meeting-heavy | Growth edge around presence, listening, patience |
| Deadline | Project urgency, growth edge around pressure |
| Light | Creative themes, strategic outcomes |
| 1:1 focused | Growth edge around coaching, support |
| Low energy | Growth edge around boundaries, sustainability |

## Examples

**Meeting-heavy day:**
```markdown
> **This Week's Focus:** Complete Q1 budget review + Theme: Presence in Density
> **Growth Edge:** Stay curious instead of rushing to solutions
```

**Deadline day:**
```markdown
> **This Week's Focus:** Ship feature X by Friday + Theme: Focused Delivery
> **Growth Edge:** Ask for help before the last moment
```

Keep it scannable — this goes directly into Today.md template.
