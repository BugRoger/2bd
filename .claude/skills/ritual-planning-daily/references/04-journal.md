Guide for generating Wins and Insights prompts.

## Wins Prompts

Generate personalized prompts connecting to:

- Today's priorities and leadership intention
- Weekly key outcomes and focus theme
- Active project milestones approaching
- Key interactions and 1:1 opportunities

Make prompts feel personalized to the specific day. Reference actual project names, people, and context.

## Insights Prompts

Generate personalized prompts connecting to:

- Patterns to watch (from Week.md coaching check-in)
- Monthly theme alignment
- Leadership development themes from directives
- Day-type context (meeting-heavy, deadline, creative)

Connect prompts to the user's growth edge and coaching questions from directives.

## Principles

- No generic templates — reference the actual day
- Connect to hierarchical context (week, month, quarter)
- Surface relevant growth edges without being preachy
- Keep prompts open-ended, not leading

## Update Today.md

After generating prompts:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Today.md`
2. Replace `## Journal` section with personalized prompts
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Today.md`

## Confirm

After writing, summarize:
- The three priorities
- The leadership intention
- Number of meetings prepared

Suggest time-blocking strategies if helpful. Confirm the day is planned.

Proceed to Reflection.
