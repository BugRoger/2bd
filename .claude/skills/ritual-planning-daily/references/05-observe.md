# Observe

Record observations for skill adaptation after the session.

## What to Observe

- Which questions the user engaged with vs skipped
- How they rephrased suggested priorities
- Whether they accepted or modified leadership intentions
- Any explicit feedback about the session

## Recording Observations

Append timestamped entries to `00_Brain/Systemic/Insights/planning-daily.md`:

```markdown
## Observations Log

- YYYY-MM-DD: [observation about user behavior or preference]
```

## Pattern Detection

When semantically similar observations appear 3+ times (e.g., variations of 'user skips energy question'):

Look at recent sessions (last 20) to detect patterns.

1. Synthesize into prose description
2. Add to appropriate section (Session Style, Priorities, Coaching Style, etc.)
3. If high confidence, add to Pending Proposals with rationale

## Template Evolution

When a template change is warranted:

1. Add proposal to Pending Proposals section
2. Ask user for confirmation
3. If confirmed, edit `00_Brain/Systemic/Templates/Captive/today.md` directly

The skill code never changes. Evolution happens in the vault.
