# Priorities Framework

Guide for establishing daily focus and leadership intention.

## Top Priorities

Identify three outcomes using the Personal → Organisational → Strategic framework:

| Priority | Focus | Connection | Example |
|----------|-------|------------|---------|
| **1. Must happen** | Critical outcome defining success | Weekly key outcomes, overdue projects | Complete budget review before noon |
| **2. Team/strategic** | Moves team or strategy forward | Monthly theme, weekly focus | Prepare for Sarah's growth conversation |
| **3. Personal/operational** | Something for yourself or routine ops | Patterns to watch from coaching | 30 min walk at lunch |

Frame as **outcomes**, not tasks. What will be different by end of day?

## Outcome vs Task

| Task (Bad) | Outcome (Good) |
|------------|----------------|
| Review budget | Budget approved with stakeholder alignment |
| Meet with Sarah | Sarah has clear growth path for Q2 |
| Walk at lunch | Protected energy for afternoon meetings |
| Fix bug | Feature working in production |
| Write docs | Team can onboard without asking me |

## Hierarchical Alignment

Connect priorities to higher context:

1. Check Week.md Key Outcomes — which needs daily progress?
2. Check active projects — which are overdue or due-soon?
3. Check Month.md theme — does any priority advance it?
4. Check Quarter.md patterns to watch — does a priority address growth edge?

## Leadership Intention

Suggest 2-3 intentions based on day shape. User chooses one.

| Day Shape | Suggested Intentions |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Heavy meetings | Present, Listening, Patient |
| Many 1:1s | Supportive, Coaching, Curious |
| Deadline pressure | Decisive, Confident, Clear |
| Low energy | Sustainable, Boundaries, Selective |
| Light calendar | Creative, Ambitious, Momentum |

## Focus Metadata

Calculate for frontmatter:
- **energy**: High/Medium/Low (ask user)
- **location**: Home/Office/Travel/Other (ask user)
- **focus_hours**: Count from calendar gaps (8am-6pm minus meetings)
- **meetings**: Count from calendar events

## Example Interaction

"Looking at your day — you have 3 hours of focus time and 4 meetings including two 1:1s.

**Priorities:**
1. Complete budget review before noon (weekly key outcome)
2. Prepare for Sarah's growth conversation (coaching mode)
3. 30 min walk at lunch (protecting energy)

**Leadership intention:** With two 1:1s today, consider: Supportive, Coaching, or Curious?"
