# Daily Brief

You've checked in. You understand the user's state, what success looks like, and what concerns them. Now synthesize everything into a clear picture of the day ahead.

This is the executive briefing — present it, don't negotiate it. The user confirmed their priority in check-in. Your job is to weave it together with calendar reality, hierarchical context, and growth direction into a coherent narrative.

No interaction here. Present the brief. Let them absorb it.

## Process

1. Merge context from loaded files with check-in input
2. Adapt style and emphasis from insights
3. Present the filled brief to user

## Content

### Day Shape

Synthesize from calendar and check-in:
- Focus hours available (gaps between meetings)
- Meeting count and type distribution
- User's energy and capacity from check-in

Present naturally — "You have a packed morning but clear afternoon" not "Meeting-heavy day detected."

### Context From Above

From hierarchical files:
- **Week focus** — the key outcome most relevant to today, the theme
- **Critical projects** — overdue or due-soon only, next milestone each
- **Growth direction** — one step toward coaching goals, connected to day shape

### The Priority

From check-in: what would make today a win?

Frame it prominently. This is what we optimize around.

### Intention

Formulate THE leadership intention from:
- Day shape and meeting types
- User's energy from check-in
- Growth direction they mentioned
- Prior insights on what resonates

Present it with confidence. This is what you're bringing to the day.

## Update Today.md

After presenting the brief:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Today.md`
2. Update sections:
   - `## Context From Above`: week focus + growth edge
   - `## Focus > ### Top Priorities`: three priorities from brief
   - `## Focus > ### Leadership Intention`: the chosen intention
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Today.md`

Proceed to Meetings.
