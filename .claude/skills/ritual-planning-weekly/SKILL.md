# Weekly Planning

1. [Setup](references/00-setup.md)
2. [Check-In](references/01-checkin.md)
3. [Week Overview](references/02-week-overview.md)
4. [Prior Synthesis](references/03-prior-synthesis.md)
5. [Priorities](references/04-priorities.md)
6. [Intention](references/05-intention.md)
7. [Reflection](references/06-reflection.md)

## Template Contract

Week.md has these H2 sections that phases update:

| Phase | Updates |
|-------|---------|
| Week Overview | `## Week Overview` |
| Prior Synthesis | `## Synthesis from Prior Week` |
| Priorities | `## Weekly Commitments` |
| Intention | `## Leadership Intention` |
| (append-only) | `## Changelog` |

Skills reference only H2s. H3 structure within sections is dynamic — the template is a living example that Reflection can evolve based on patterns.
