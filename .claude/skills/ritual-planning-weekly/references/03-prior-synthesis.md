# Prior Synthesis

Synthesize learnings from the prior week to inform this week's planning.

If prior week's daily archives are available, analyze them. If not, skip this phase and note the gap.

## Process

1. Load prior week's archived daily files
2. Analyze for patterns
3. Present synthesis to user
4. Capture any additional reflections

## Analysis

### Energy Trend

From daily archives:

- **Average energy** — across daily check-ins
- **Pattern** — rising, stable, declining through the week
- **Notable dips or spikes** — what caused them

### Accomplishments

From daily archives and prior Week.md:

- **Completed priorities** — what got done from prior week's commitments
- **Notable wins** — categorized by personal, organisational, strategic
- **Unexpected progress** — things that happened outside the plan

### Carryover Candidates

From prior Week.md and daily archives:

- **Incomplete priorities** — what didn't get done
- **Items marked "Carry Forward"** — from prior week's Next Week Setup
- **Patterns observed** — recurring items that need continued attention

### Leadership Development

From prior Week.md:

- **Which intentions were used** — did the leadership intention stick?
- **Growth edge progress** — evidence of movement
- **Coaching patterns** — what surfaced during the week

## Present to User

Summarize findings naturally:
- "Last week you got X done but Y rolled over"
- "Your energy dipped mid-week — worth watching"
- "You practiced [intention] particularly well in [context]"

Ask: "Anything else to capture from last week before we move on?"

## Update Week.md

After synthesis:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Week.md`
2. Replace `## Synthesis from Prior Week` section with:
   - Carryover priorities (what's rolling forward)
   - Patterns observed (what to watch)
   - Leadership development progress (growth edge evidence)
   - Key relationships (who needs attention)
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Week.md`

Proceed to Priorities.
