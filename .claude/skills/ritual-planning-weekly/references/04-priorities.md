# Priorities

Guide the user to three weekly outcomes aligned with the hierarchy.

You've synthesized the prior week. You've presented the week shape. Now help the user commit to what matters.

## Framework

Three outcomes, each serving a different dimension:

1. **Personal** — What personal habit, boundary, or leadership skill will you strengthen?
   - Connect to growth edge from Year.md
   - Reference patterns observed from prior week
   - Make it behavioral, not aspirational

2. **Organisational** — What team conversation, decision, or collaboration is needed?
   - Align with quarterly themes
   - Reference key relationships from synthesis
   - Make it relational, not task-oriented

3. **Strategic** — What deliverable moves the quarter forward?
   - Reference active projects with urgency
   - Connect to quarterly outcomes
   - Make it outcome-focused, not activity-based

## Coaching

Frame these as outcomes, not tasks. What will be different by end of week?

Help the user refine:
- If too vague → "What would you see or feel if this succeeded?"
- If too task-focused → "What's the outcome behind this task?"
- If disconnected from hierarchy → "How does this connect to [quarter theme]?"

Reference coaching questions from Quarter.md when helpful.

## Additional Commitments

Beyond the three outcomes, capture:

**Key Decisions** — Decisions that must be made this week
**People to Connect With** — Relationships to nurture or conversations to have
**Boundaries to Hold** — What you're protecting this week
**Growth Challenge** — One specific thing to try differently

## Update Week.md

After setting priorities:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Week.md`
2. Replace `## Weekly Commitments` section with:
   - Three key outcomes (Personal, Organisational, Strategic)
   - Key decisions
   - People to connect with
   - Boundaries
   - Growth challenge
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Week.md`

Proceed to Intention.
