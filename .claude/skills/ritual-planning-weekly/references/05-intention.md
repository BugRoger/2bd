# Intention

Set the leadership intention based on week type and user context.

You've set the priorities. Now anchor them with a leadership intention — how the user will show up this week.

## Week Type Intentions

Suggest 2-3 intentions based on week type:

### meeting-heavy
- **Present** — Fully engaged in every conversation
- **Listening** — Asking more than telling
- **Patient** — Not rushing decisions
- **Boundaries** — Protecting recovery time

### focus
- **Deep** — Extended concentration on important work
- **Creative** — Space for new ideas
- **Ambitious** — Tackling the hard thing
- **Uninterruptible** — Protecting focus blocks

### deadline
- **Decisive** — Making calls quickly
- **Clear** — No ambiguity in communication
- **Urgent** — Appropriate pace without panic
- **Focused** — Saying no to distractions

### travel
- **Flexible** — Adapting to disruption
- **Async** — Effective written communication
- **Prepared** — Ready for key moments

### balanced
- **Strategic** — Working on the right things
- **Intentional** — Purposeful time allocation
- **Sustainable** — Maintaining energy reserves

## Process

1. Present relevant intentions for the week type
2. Connect to growth edge from check-in conversation
3. Let the user choose or suggest their own
4. Confirm the selection

One intention. Not multiple. What's the leadership stance for this week?

## Coaching Prompts

Generate personalized prompts connecting to:

**For Coaching Check-in:**
- Patterns to watch from Quarter.md
- Growth edge from Year.md
- Week type implications

**For Wins sections:**
- Weekly outcomes to celebrate
- Leadership intention to demonstrate
- Project milestones approaching
- Key relationships to nurture

**For Reflections:**
- Week type challenges to anticipate
- Prior week patterns to build on or break
- Growth edge opportunities

## Confirm

After selection, summarize the week:

- The three weekly outcomes
- The leadership intention
- The week type and key challenges
- Number of meetings and focus hours

Suggest strategies for the week type if helpful.

## Update Week.md

After setting intention:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Week.md`
2. Replace `## Leadership Intention` section with:
   - The selected intention
   - Connection to growth edge
   - How to demonstrate it this week
3. Update frontmatter:
   - `leadership_intention`: selected intention
4. Add coaching prompts to relevant sections
5. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Week.md`

Proceed to Reflection.
