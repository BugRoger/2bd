# Prior Synthesis

Synthesize learnings and accomplishments from the prior year to ground this year's planning.

## Process

If prior year archive exists (from Setup), synthesize and present:

### Year Theme & Trajectory

- What last year was about — the narrative arc
- How quarterly themes evolved through the year
- Overall trajectory: improving, stable, or challenging?

### Accomplishments

Organize by the three goal categories:

**Personal:**
- Leadership growth moments
- Growth edge progress
- Key patterns that emerged

**Organisational:**
- Team evolution and capability built
- Structures or processes established
- Culture shifts achieved

**Strategic:**
- Major project completions or milestones
- Initiatives that moved forward
- Impact delivered

### Carryover Candidates

Surface what should flow into the new year:

- Incomplete goals or initiatives worth continuing
- Strategic patterns that need continued attention
- Relationships to maintain or deepen
- Unfinished leadership development work

### Leadership Development Progress

- How the growth edge evolved across the year
- Key coaching moments and breakthroughs
- Leadership identity development
- Patterns that emerged in leadership behavior

## If Prior Data Unavailable

If no prior year archive exists:

1. Note the absence
2. Ask user to share key memories from the year
3. Work with what they provide

## Update Year.md

After presenting synthesis:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Year.md`
2. Add `## Synthesis from Prior Year` section after frontmatter navigation
3. Include:
   - Brief narrative of prior year's theme
   - Key accomplishments (bullet summary)
   - Carryover items identified
   - Leadership development trajectory
4. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Year.md`

Proceed to Life Context.
