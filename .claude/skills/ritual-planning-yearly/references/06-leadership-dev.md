# Leadership Development

Establish the leadership development context that cascades to all quarterly and monthly planning.

## Components

### Primary Focus

Guide the user to identify one primary leadership competency to develop.

**Characteristics:**
- Connects to growth edge
- Applicable across multiple situations
- Would unlock significant growth if mastered
- Specific enough to practice daily

**Examples:**
- "Listening deeply before responding"
- "Delegating with trust, not micromanaging"
- "Creating clarity in ambiguity"
- "Having difficult conversations early"
- "Saying no to protect what matters"
- "Being vulnerable about what I don't know"
- "Staying strategic when pulled into details"
- "Building silence into conversations"

### Secondary Focus

A supporting competency that complements the primary focus.

**Questions:**
- What would support the primary focus?
- What's another area needing attention?
- What emerged from prior year's development?

### Leadership Identity

Help the user articulate who they are becoming as a leader.

**Format:** "I am a leader who..."

**Characteristics:**
- Aspirational but grounded
- 1-2 sentences
- Captures the leader they want to be
- Something to grow into, not just describe

**Examples:**
- "I am a leader who creates clarity, develops people, and builds sustainable high-performing teams."
- "I am a leader who leads with curiosity, empowers through trust, and makes the complex simple."
- "I am a leader who brings calm to chaos, coaches rather than directs, and models sustainable excellence."
- "I am a leader who sees potential in people, creates space for growth, and holds high standards with compassion."

### Growth Edge

The specific stretch area where discomfort lives.

**Characteristics:**
- The thing they tend to avoid or struggle with
- If addressed, would unlock significant growth
- Specific enough to notice in the moment
- Connected to recurring patterns

**Examples:**
- "Having difficult conversations early instead of avoiding them"
- "Letting go of details to operate at strategic altitude"
- "Saying no to protect focus on what matters most"
- "Being vulnerable about what I don't know"
- "Trusting my team to figure things out without my input"
- "Slowing down when I want to rush to solutions"

## Coherence Check

Before finalizing, verify alignment:

1. Does primary focus address the growth edge?
2. Does leadership identity reflect the aspiration?
3. Does this connect to the personal goal?
4. Would this development serve the year's theme?

## Update Year.md

After defining leadership development:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Year.md`
2. Update `## Leadership Development` section:
   - Primary focus
   - Secondary focus
   - Leadership identity statement
   - Growth edge
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Year.md`

Proceed to Reflection.
