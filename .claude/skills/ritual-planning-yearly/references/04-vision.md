# Vision

Guide the user to one clear theme for the year — a narrative anchor that shapes quarterly decisions.

## Theme Development

The theme should be:
- Memorable — easy to recall when making decisions
- Meaningful — captures what this year needs to be about
- Motivating — something worth working toward

### Theme Considerations

Explore through conversation:

- What does this year need to be about?
- What would make this year meaningful when you look back?
- What's the narrative arc you want to write?
- What emerged from prior synthesis and life context?

### Theme Examples by Context

Offer these as inspiration, not prescription:

**Transition Contexts:**
- New role: "Year of Becoming" — Growing into expanded responsibilities
- New team: "Year of Foundation" — Establishing new norms and culture
- After difficult year: "Year of Sustainability" — Rebuilding with intention

**Growth Contexts:**
- Scaling team: "Year of Leverage" — Building systems and developing leaders
- Ready for next level: "Year of Emergence" — Stepping into larger leadership
- Deepening expertise: "Year of Mastery" — Going deep before going wide

**Achievement Contexts:**
- Major initiative: "Year of Execution" — Delivering on strategic commitments
- Transformation work: "Year of Change" — Leading significant shifts
- Multiple big bets: "Year of Momentum" — Building and sustaining velocity

**Personal Contexts:**
- Work-life recalibration: "Year of Balance" — Integrating priorities
- After burnout: "Year of Recovery" — Rebuilding capacity sustainably
- Creative ambitions: "Year of Creation" — Making things that matter

### Refining the Theme

Once a direction emerges:

1. Test it against life context — does it fit the reality?
2. Test it against prior year — is it the right continuation or pivot?
3. Articulate what it means in practice — how will it guide decisions?

## Update Year.md

After settling on theme:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Year.md`
2. Replace `## Year Overview` section (within the section, update `### Vision & Theme`)
3. Include:
   - The chosen theme
   - What it means for this year
   - How it emerged from context
4. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Year.md`

Proceed to Goals.
