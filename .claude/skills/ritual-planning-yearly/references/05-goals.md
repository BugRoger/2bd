### 3. Strategic — Achievement

## Refining Goals

For each goal:

1. Test against theme — does it support the year's direction?
2. Test against context — is it achievable given reality?
3. Test specificity — will you know if you achieved it?
4. Test meaning — does it matter enough to drive behavior?

## Update Year.md

After defining goals:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Year.md`
2. Update `### Key Annual Goals` within `## Year Overview`:
   - Goal 1: Personal leadership growth
   - Goal 2: Organisational capability
   - Goal 3: Strategic achievement
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Year.md`

Proceed to Leadership Development.
