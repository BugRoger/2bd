# Yearly Planning

1. [Setup](references/00-setup.md)
2. [Check-In](references/01-checkin.md)
3. [Prior Synthesis](references/02-prior-synthesis.md)
4. [Life Context](references/03-life-context.md)
5. [Vision](references/04-vision.md)
6. [Goals](references/05-goals.md)
7. [Leadership Development](references/06-leadership-dev.md)
8. [Observe](references/07-observe.md)

## Template Contract

Year.md has these H2 sections that phases update:

| Phase | Updates |
|-------|---------|
| Prior Synthesis | `## Synthesis from Prior Year` |
| Life Context | `## Life Context` |
| Vision | `## Vision & Theme` |
| Goals | `## Annual Goals` |
| Leadership Development | `## Leadership Development` |
| (append-only) | `## Changelog` |

Skills reference only H2s. H3 structure within sections is dynamic — the template is a living example that Observe can evolve based on patterns.
