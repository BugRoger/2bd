# Coaching Synthesis

Synthesize coaching themes from the quarter for learning and evolution.

## Patterns Review

Review "Patterns to Watch" from Quarter.md's Coaching Themes section.

For each pattern:
- Did it emerge this quarter? How often?
- What triggered it when it appeared?
- Did it improve, worsen, or stay stable?
- Should it remain a watched pattern or graduate?

Patterns can graduate when:
- Consistently managed for a full quarter
- No longer causing friction
- Replaced by deeper self-awareness

Ask: "Which pattern taught you the most about yourself?"

## Questions Review

Review "Questions That Serve Me" from Quarter.md.

For each question:
- When did you use it this quarter?
- Did it create useful reflection?
- Should it continue or evolve?

Identify new questions that emerged:
- From monthly reviews
- From leadership moments
- From challenges faced

Ask: "What new question would serve you next quarter?"
