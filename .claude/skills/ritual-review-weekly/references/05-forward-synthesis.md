# Forward Synthesis

Review carry-forward items and set up next week for success.

## Gather Carry-Forwards

### From Daily Archives

Scan each daily archive for:
- Priorities not completed
- Items explicitly marked for carry-forward
- Decisions deferred

### From Week.md

Check current Week.md for:
- Key outcomes not yet achieved
- Open items in any section
- Coaching patterns still being watched

### From People Review

Include follow-ups identified:
- Action items from 1:1s
- Relationship maintenance tasks

## Relevance Check

Present all carry-forward items and ask:

"Which of these are still relevant for next week?"

For each item, determine:
- **Still relevant** — Move to next week
- **Completed elsewhere** — Archive note
- **No longer needed** — Drop with note why
- **Needs delegation** — Note who and how

## Incomplete Decisions

Surface decisions that weren't finalized:

"Are there decisions from this week that need closure?"

Look for:
- Items discussed but not concluded
- Requests awaiting response
- Options being evaluated

For each, ask:
- Can it be decided now?
- What's blocking the decision?
- Who else needs to be involved?

## Next Week Focus

Guide forward-looking synthesis:

### Focus Theme

"What should be next week's focus theme?"

Connect to:
- Incomplete high-priority items
- Upcoming key dates from Month.md
- Energy recovery needs
- Strategic priorities from Quarter.md

### Success Definition

"What one thing would make next week successful?"

This becomes the seed for next week's planning.

### Coaching Forward

Connect to growth edge:
- What pattern to continue watching?
- What to do differently?
- What support is needed?

## Update Week.md

After synthesis:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Week.md`
2. Update `## Next Week Setup` section with:
   - Carry-forward items (filtered for relevance)
   - Incomplete decisions needing attention
   - Suggested focus theme
   - Success definition
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Week.md`

Proceed to Compose.
