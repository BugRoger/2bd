# Leadership Reflection

Review leadership intentions from daily archives and synthesize patterns about being at one's best.

## Gather Intentions

From each daily archive, extract:

- The leadership intention set during planning
- Any notes about how it played out
- Related wins or insights mentioning leadership

List intentions by day:
```
Monday: "Be curious before correcting"
Tuesday: "Create space for others to lead"
Wednesday: "Model calm under pressure"
...
```

## Embodiment Rating

For each day's intention, ask:

"How well did you embody '[intention]' on [day]? (1-10)"

Record ratings alongside intentions.

## Synthesize Patterns

After gathering all ratings, guide reflection:

### Best Embodiment

"Which intention served you best this week? What made it work?"

Look for:
- Highest-rated intention
- Context that supported success
- Behaviors that aligned with intention

### Struggle Points

"Where did you struggle to embody your intentions? What got in the way?"

Look for:
- Lowest-rated intentions
- Patterns in what disrupted alignment
- External vs internal factors

### Pattern Recognition

"What pattern emerges about when you're at your best as a leader?"

Connect to:
- Day types (meeting-heavy, creative, deadline)
- Energy levels from daily archives
- Interaction contexts (1:1s, group, async)
