## Reflection Prompts

After categorization, guide reflection:

### Pride Point

"Which win are you most proud of this week?"

Explore why this one stands out. What does it say about current priorities?

### Theme Identification

"What theme connects these wins?"

Look for patterns:
- A project that dominated

"How does the distribution across categories feel?"

Note if one category dominates or is absent. Connect to week type and intentions.
