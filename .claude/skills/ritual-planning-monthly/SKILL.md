# Monthly Planning

1. [Setup](references/00-setup.md)
2. [Check-In](references/01-checkin.md)
3. [Month Overview](references/02-month-overview.md)
4. [Prior Synthesis](references/03-prior-synthesis.md)
5. [Outcomes](references/04-outcomes.md)
6. [Theme](references/05-theme.md)
7. [Observe](references/06-observe.md)

## Template Contract

Month.md has these H2 sections that phases update:

| Phase | Updates |
|-------|---------|
| Month Overview | `## Month Overview` |
| Prior Synthesis | `## Synthesis from Prior Month` |
| Outcomes | `## Key Outcomes` |
| Theme | `## Monthly Theme` |
| (append-only) | `## Changelog` |

Skills reference only H2s. H3 structure within sections is dynamic — the template is a living example that Observe can evolve based on patterns.
