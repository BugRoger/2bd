# Month Overview

You've checked in. You understand the user's state. Now present the shape of the month ahead.

This is the executive briefing on what the month looks like — present it, don't negotiate it.

## Process

1. Determine position in quarter
2. Extract key dates from hierarchical context
3. Analyze project timeline urgency
4. Present the overview to user

## Content

### Position in Quarter

From resolved date:

- **Month 1** — Foundation month: alignment, planning, establishing rhythm
- **Month 2** — Execution month: momentum, iteration, mid-quarter adjustment
- **Month 3** — Delivery month: closure, completion, preparation for next quarter

Present naturally — "This is the execution month of Q2, where momentum matters most" not "Position in quarter analysis complete."

### Key Dates Preview

Reference Quarter.md and Year.md to extract key dates.

**Countdown alerts:**
- Show dates within 45 days with urgency indicators
- Group by week for monthly overview
- Highlight deadlines and prep-required events
- Note any dates cascading from Quarter/Year

Ask: "Any other key dates to add for this month?"

Capture additional dates for inclusion in Month.md Key Dates section.

### Hierarchical Context

**Quarterly Context** (from Quarter.md):
- Quarterly Theme — What this quarter is about
- Key Outcomes — The three quarterly outcomes
- Patterns to Watch — Self-awareness patterns for coaching

If any context is unavailable, note it and continue.

## Update Month.md

After presenting the overview:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Month.md`
2. Replace `## Month Overview` section with:
   - Position in quarter
   - Key dates with countdown by week
   - Context cascade summary
   - Project timeline overview
3. Update frontmatter:
   - `position_in_quarter`: [first|middle|final]
4. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Month.md`

Proceed to Prior Synthesis.
