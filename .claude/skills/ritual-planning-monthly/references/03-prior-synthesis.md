# Prior Synthesis

Synthesize learnings from the prior month to inform this month's planning.

If prior month's weekly archives are available, analyze them. If not, skip this phase and note the gap.

## Process

1. Load prior month's archived weekly files
2. Analyze for patterns
3. Present synthesis to user
4. Capture any additional reflections

## Analysis

### Energy Trend

From weekly archives:

- **Average energy** — across weekly check-ins
- **Pattern** — rising, stable, declining through the month
- **Notable dips or spikes** — what caused them
- **Week type distribution** — how many focus vs meeting-heavy weeks

### Accomplishments

From weekly archives and prior Month.md:

- **Completed outcomes** — what got done from prior month's key outcomes
- **Notable wins** — categorized by personal, organisational, strategic
- **Project progress** — milestones reached, deliverables shipped
- **Unexpected progress** — things that happened outside the plan

### Carryover Candidates

From prior Month.md and weekly archives:

- **Incomplete outcomes** — what didn't get done
- **Items marked "Carry Forward"** — from prior month's setup
- **Patterns observed** — recurring themes that need continued attention
- **Blocked work** — what got stuck and why

### Leadership Development

From prior Month.md:

- **Theme alignment** — did the monthly theme stick?
- **Growth edge progress** — evidence of movement
- **Coaching patterns** — what surfaced during the month
- **Key relationships** — who got nurtured, who needs attention

## Present to User

Summarize findings naturally:
- "Last month you completed X outcomes but Y rolled over"
- "Your energy tracked [pattern] — worth watching this month"
- "You made notable progress on [growth edge] particularly in [context]"

Ask: "Anything else to capture from last month before we move on?"

## Update Month.md

After synthesis:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Month.md`
2. Replace `## Synthesis from Prior Month` section with:
   - Carryover outcomes (what's rolling forward)
   - Energy pattern summary (what to watch)
   - Leadership development progress (growth edge evidence)
   - Key relationships (who needs attention this month)
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Month.md`

Proceed to Outcomes.
