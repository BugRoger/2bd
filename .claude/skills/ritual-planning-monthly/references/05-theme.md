# Theme

Set the monthly theme based on position in quarter and context signals.

You've set the outcomes. Now anchor them with a monthly theme — the through-line that connects everything.

## Position-Based Themes

Suggest 2-3 themes based on position in quarter:

### First Month (Foundation)
- **Alignment** — Getting everyone pointed the same direction
- **Planning** — Setting the stage for quarterly success
- **Exploration** — Testing approaches before committing
- **Foundation** — Building the base for later execution

### Middle Month (Execution)
- **Momentum** — Maintaining velocity on key initiatives
- **Iteration** — Refining based on early learnings
- **Depth** — Going deeper on what's working
- **Focus** — Saying no to protect what matters

### Final Month (Delivery)
- **Closure** — Completing what was started
- **Delivery** — Shipping the quarterly milestone
- **Preparation** — Positioning for next quarter
- **Integration** — Connecting learnings to next steps

## Context Signals

Augment position-based suggestions with:

- **Quarter theme** — How does this month serve the quarter's focus?
- **Project urgency** — Are there deadlines driving the rhythm?
- **Prior month patterns** — What energy and patterns carry forward?
- **Annual goals** — Which annual goal needs attention now?
- **User's stated concerns** — What's weighing on them?

## Process

1. Present relevant themes for position in quarter
2. Connect to outcomes just defined
3. Reference context signals
4. Let the user choose or suggest their own
5. Confirm the selection

One theme. Not multiple. What's the organizing principle for this month?

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Month.md`
2. Replace `## Monthly Theme` section with:
   - The selected theme
   - Connection to quarter theme
   - How to demonstrate it this month
3. Update frontmatter:
