# Outcomes

Guide the user to three monthly outcomes aligned with the hierarchy.

You've synthesized the prior month. You've presented the month shape. Now help the user commit to what matters.

## Framework

Three outcomes, each serving a different dimension:

1. **Personal** — What personal development will you invest in?
   - Connect to growth edge from Year.md
   - Reference patterns observed from prior month
   - What habit, boundary, or skill strengthens?
   - Make it behavioral, not aspirational

2. **Organisational** — What team capability will you build?
   - Align with quarterly outcomes
   - What conversations or decisions strengthen the team?
   - Reference key relationships from synthesis
   - Make it relational and capacity-building

3. **Strategic** — What milestone marks this month complete?
   - Reference active projects with urgency
   - Connect to quarterly outcomes directly
   - What deliverable moves the quarter forward?
   - Make it outcome-focused, not activity-based

## Coaching

Frame these as outcomes, not tasks. What will be different by end of month?

Help the user refine:
- If too vague → "What would you see or feel if this succeeded?"
- If too task-focused → "What's the outcome behind this task?"
- If disconnected from hierarchy → "How does this connect to [quarter theme]?"

Reference coaching questions from Quarter.md when helpful.

## Additional Commitments

Beyond the three outcomes, capture:

**Key Decisions** — Major decisions that must be made this month
**Projects Requiring Focus** — Which active projects need concentrated attention
**Relationships to Nurture** — Key people to connect with this month
**Boundaries to Hold** — What you're protecting this month
**Development Challenge** — One specific leadership skill to practice

## Update Month.md

After setting outcomes:

1. Read `00_Brain/Captive/Month.md`
2. Replace `## Key Outcomes` section with:
   - Three key outcomes (Personal, Organisational, Strategic)
   - Key decisions
   - Projects requiring focus
   - Relationships to nurture
   - Boundaries
   - Development challenge
3. Write entire file back to `00_Brain/Captive/Month.md`

Proceed to Theme.
