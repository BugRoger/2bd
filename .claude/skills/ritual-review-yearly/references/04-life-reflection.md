# Life Reflection

Step back from accomplishments and leadership to reflect on how the year changed you as a person.

## How the Year Changed You

Beyond leadership and goals:
- How are you different from who you were in January?
- What did this year teach you about yourself?
- What beliefs or assumptions shifted?
- What priorities changed?

Ask: "What do you know now that you didn't know at the start of the year?"

## Gratitude

Before looking ahead, acknowledge what made the year possible:

### People
- Who supported your growth this year?
- Who challenged you in helpful ways?
- Who did you underappreciate?

### Circumstances
- What lucky breaks or fortunate timing occurred?
- What difficult circumstances turned out to be valuable?

### Self
- What about yourself are you grateful for?
- What personal qualities served you well?

Ask: "Who deserves your thanks that you haven't given?"

## What You'd Tell Yourself

> "If you could send a message to yourself in January, what would it be?"

This reveals:
- What you wish you'd known
- What fears turned out to be unfounded
- What you'd do differently with hindsight

## What Defined This Year

Guide toward a one-paragraph narrative that captures the essence:

- What was the central theme or through-line?
- What will you remember most?
- If you described this year in one sentence, what would it be?

This becomes the year's archived summary.

## Wins Celebration

Before closing, celebrate what was accomplished:

### Personal Wins
- What mattered to you personally?
- What made you proud?

### Professional Wins
- What impact did you have?
- What did you build or accomplish?

### Relationship Wins
- Who did you help?
- What relationships deepened?

This year deserves acknowledgment.
