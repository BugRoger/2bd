# Leadership Journey

The heart of yearly review — understanding how leadership identity evolved over twelve months.

## Growth Edge Evolution

Reference growth_edge from directives and Year.md.

Explore the year-long journey:
> "Your growth edge was [growth_edge]. How did your relationship with it change across the year?"

Quarter-by-quarter trajectory:
- Q1: Where did it show up? How did you respond?
- Q2: What shifted?
- Q3: What became easier or harder?
- Q4: Where did you end up?

Ask: "What became natural that felt difficult in January?"

## Leadership Identity Development

Reference leadership_identity from directives.

Explore how the identity was lived:
> "You aspired to be a leader who [leadership_identity]. How did you embody that?"

Look for:
- Moments of strong alignment
- Decisions that reflected the identity
- Gaps between aspiration and action
- Evolution in how you think about leadership

Ask: "How would you update your leadership identity statement now?"

## Key Coaching Moments

Review significant coaching moments from quarterly archives:
- Which moment had the most impact?
- What patterns appeared across quarters?
- Which insight changed how you operate?
- What would you share with another leader?

Identify the through-line:
> "What's the thread that connects these moments?"
