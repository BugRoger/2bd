# Yearly Review

1. [Setup](references/00-setup.md)
2. [Year Summary](references/01-year-summary.md)
3. [Goal Review](references/02-goal-review.md)
4. [Leadership Journey](references/03-leadership-journey.md)
5. [Life Reflection](references/04-life-reflection.md)
6. [Compose](references/05-compose.md)
7. [Persist](references/06-persist.md)
8. [Observe](references/07-observe.md)

## Template Contract

Year.md sections updated during review:

| Phase | Updates |
|-------|---------|
| Year Summary | `## Year Summary` |
| Goal Review | `## Goal Review` |
| Leadership Journey | `## Leadership Journey` |
| Life Reflection | `## Life Reflection` |
| (append-only) | `## Changelog` |

Skills reference only H2s. H3 structure within sections is dynamic — the template is a living example that Observe can evolve based on patterns.
