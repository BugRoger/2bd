	- [ISSUE] Missing GCO TV blocks positions requiring location change to St.Leon-Rot.
	- [ISSUE] LinkedIn Campain stuck with GPO/Employee Branding
* Workshop Outcomes
	* Portability / Lifecycle
		* Invest Pegasus HC to speed up adoption of OCM Tooling, RBSC for Air-Gapped and Brownfield Migration. Reuse findings from already ongoing ApeiroRA CobaltCore engagement

		* Additional invest into Metal-API for supporting additional hardware vendors
		* [ISSUE] Partner Play
	* Autonomous Operations

		* Team to be incubated within CE Workload Mgmt
		* Ensure interpretability with SCI Scheduling Service

		* [ISSUE] No direct value for AI Core. Integration of SCI as additional LLM Provider akin to Azure, Google, AWS is possible, but has no intrinsic value to AI Core as the same delivery is being already done in-house
		* [ISSUE] Proposal for SCI to take over AI Core Delivery for all Inference engines. Not fundable with Pegasus. Need 15 HC
		* [ISSUE] Expert opinion LLM Weight Protection
	* Sustainability
		* Co-Development CE Observability and Frank Feinbube
