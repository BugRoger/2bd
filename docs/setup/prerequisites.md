## Required

### Claude Code CLI

Install [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), Anthropic's CLI for Claude.

### Cloud sync folder

2bd stores your notes in a cloud-synced folder so they follow you across devices:

- **OneDrive** (recommended)
- iCloud Drive
- Dropbox
- Google Drive

Choose a path like `~/OneDrive/2bd-vault` or `~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive/2bd-vault`.

## Recommended

### Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is the recommended editor for browsing and writing in your vault. It's free and works on all platforms.

2bd works with any markdown editor, but Obsidian's features (graph view, templates, hotkeys) integrate well with the workflow.
