2bd organizes notes by **metabolic state** rather than topic. This mirrors how information naturally flows from capture to crystallization.

## The five states

### Captive — Working notes

High-velocity, volatile intake. This is where you write daily.

**Location:** `00_Brain/Captive/`

**Files:**
- `Today.md` — Daily capture, meetings, tasks
- `Week.md` — Weekly focus and progress
- `Month.md` — Monthly themes and goals
- `Quarter.md` — Quarterly direction
- `Year.md` — Annual vision

**Flow:** Planning rituals prepare these from templates. Review rituals archive them to Periodic.

### Synthetic — Active drafts

Short-term executive memory. Projects in progress, drafts being refined.

**Location:** `00_Brain/Synthetic/`

**Purpose:** Active project work that isn't yet crystallized knowledge. Also stores self-learning observations before they mature into insights.

### Periodic — Archives

The permanent timeline. Every period gets a unique, consecutive note.

**Location:** `00_Brain/Periodic/`

**Structure:**
- `Daily/` — `2026-02-08.md`, `2026-02-09.md`, ...
- `Weekly/` — `2026-W06.md`, `2026-W07.md`, ...
- `Monthly/` — `2026-02.md`, `2026-03.md`, ...
- `Quarterly/` — `2026-Q1.md`, `2026-Q2.md`, ...
- `Yearly/` — `2026.md`, `2027.md`, ...

**Flow:** Review rituals archive Captive notes here. This is the permanent record.

### Semantic — Reference

Crystallized knowledge. Evergreen notes that remain useful over time.

**Location:** `00_Brain/Semantic/`

**Purpose:** Insights that have graduated from observation through the self-learning pipeline. Reference material you return to.

### Systemic — Structure

Templates, workflows, and configuration. The infrastructure that supports the system.

**Location:** `00_Brain/Systemic/`

**Structure:**
- `Templates/` — Templates for all note types
- `Directives/` — User profile and AI personality
- `Coaching/` — Coaching prompts and guidance

## Information flow

```
Captive (you write)              Periodic (rituals archive)
────────────────────             ────────────────────────────
Today.md   ──review──►           Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md
Week.md    ──review──►           Weekly/YYYY-Www.md
Month.md   ──review──►           Monthly/YYYY-MM.md
Quarter.md ──review──►           Quarterly/YYYY-QN.md
Year.md    ──review──►           Yearly/YYYY.md
```

## Why metabolic states?

Traditional systems organize by topic (work, personal, projects). This fails because:

1. **Topics are subjective** — Where does a work project that affects your personal life go?
2. **Topics multiply** — You end up with hundreds of folders
3. **Topics hide stale notes** — Old notes in topic folders never get reviewed

Metabolic states solve this by organizing around **information lifecycle**:

- Fresh notes go to Captive
- Active work lives in Synthetic
- Completed work archives to Periodic
- Timeless knowledge crystallizes in Semantic

The system naturally moves information from volatile to permanent without you deciding where things go.
