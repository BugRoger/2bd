## What is GPS?

GPS is a three-layer framework for turning ambitions into daily action.

| Layer | Question | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Goal** | What do I want? | Direction and motivation |
| **Plan** | How will I get there? | Strategy and milestones |
| **System** | What do I do today? | Daily execution and habits |

Most productivity systems fail because they focus on one layer. GPS connects all three so your daily actions actually move you toward your goals.

## GPS components

### Goal Layer

| Component | Purpose | Timescale |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Life Compass** | Core values, life areas, what matters most | Yearly |
| **3-Year Sketch** | Longer-term vision, directional aims | Yearly |
| **Why** | The motivation behind each goal | Yearly |
| **Anti-Goals** | What you explicitly avoid | Yearly |

### Plan Layer

| Component | Purpose | Timescale |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Quarterly Quest** | One primary focus for the quarter | Quarterly |
| **Major Moves** | 3-5 strategic initiatives that advance the quest | Quarterly |
| **80% Reality Check** | Constraints, blockers, capacity assessment | Quarterly |
| **Crystal Ball** | What success looks like at quarter end | Quarterly |

### System Layer

| Component | Purpose | Timescale |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Balanced Week Blueprint** | Ideal week structure, recurring commitments | Weekly |
| **1-3-5 Daily Method** | Daily task selection (1 big, 3 medium, 5 small) | Daily |
| **Tracking** | Progress metrics, habit streaks | Daily |
| **Reminders** | Nudges and triggers | Daily |
| **Accountability** | Check-ins, commitments shared | Weekly |

## Timescale mapping

Where each GPS component lives in 2bd:

| Timescale | Goal Layer | Plan Layer | System Layer |
|-----------|------------|------------|--------------|
| **Yearly** | Life Compass, 3-Year Sketch, Why, Anti-Goals | - | - |
| **Quarterly** | - | Quarterly Quest, Major Moves, 80% Reality Check, Crystal Ball | - |
| **Weekly** | - | - | Balanced Week Blueprint, Accountability |
| **Daily** | - | - | 1-3-5 tasks, Tracking, Reminders |

## The cascade

Goals flow down through timescales. Each level inherits context from above.

```
Yearly    →  Life Compass defines life areas
              ↓
Quarterly →  Quarterly Quest focuses one area
              ↓
Weekly    →  Balanced Week Blueprint allocates time
              ↓
Daily     →  1-3-5 picks today's tasks from the week
```

**Planning rituals** pull context downward. Your daily plan inherits quarterly priorities.

**Reflection rituals** synthesize upward. Daily wins inform weekly reviews. Weekly patterns shape quarterly direction.

## 1-3-5 daily method

A simple constraint that prevents overcommitment:

| Category | Count | Definition |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **Big** | 1 | The one thing that moves the needle |
| **Medium** | 3 | Important tasks that support the big one |
| **Small** | 5 | Quick wins, admin, maintenance |

**Total: 9 items maximum per day.**

The constraint forces prioritization. If you cannot fit a task, something else must go.

## Built-in system anchors

2bd embeds GPS behaviors into rituals automatically:

| Timescale | Planning anchor | Reflection anchor |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Yearly** | Review Life Compass, set annual direction | Assess year against goals |
| **Quarterly** | Define Quarterly Quest, Major Moves | Evaluate quest completion |
| **Weekly** | Create Balanced Week Blueprint | Review week patterns |
| **Daily** | Select 1-3-5 tasks | Log wins and learnings |

You do not need to remember GPS. The rituals prompt you at the right time.
