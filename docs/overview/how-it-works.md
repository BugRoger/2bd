## The ritual loop

2bd operates on a simple cycle: **plan → work → review → archive**.

![Planning and review cycles across time scales](/images/how-it-works.svg)

### Planning rituals

Run in the morning (or start of period). They:
- Load context from higher timescales
- Fetch calendar events (if configured)
- Prepare your working note from a template
- Prompt for intention setting

### Review rituals

Run in the evening (or end of period). They:
- Guide reflection on wins and learnings
- Archive your working note to Periodic
- Extract insights to People/, Projects/, Insights/
- Record observations for self-learning

## Time scales

The loop runs at four scales, each nesting into the next:

| Scale | Planning | Review | Working note | Archive |
|-------|----------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Daily | Morning | Evening | Today.md | Daily/ |
| Weekly | Monday | Sunday | Week.md | Weekly/ |
| Quarterly | Start | End of quarter | Quarter.md | Quarterly/ |
| Yearly | January | December | Year.md | Yearly/ |

## Information flow

```
Captive (you write)              Periodic (rituals archive)
────────────────────             ────────────────────────────
Today.md   ──review──►           Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md
Week.md    ──review──►           Weekly/YYYY-Www.md
Quarter.md ──review──►           Quarterly/YYYY-QN.md
Year.md    ──review──►           Yearly/YYYY.md
```

Daily insights feed into weekly reviews. Weekly patterns inform quarterly direction. The system synthesizes upward automatically.

## Self-learning

Rituals learn from your behavior:

1. **Reflect** — Track how you modify templates
2. **Cluster** — Group similar patterns
3. **Graduate** — Stable patterns mature automatically
4. **Crystallize** — Insights update templates

Your templates evolve to match how you actually work.
